# openapi3-ref-example

This is an example of how to split an OpenAPI 3 specification into separate files for ease-of-use.

It uses the [`petstore.yaml`](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml) example from the OpenAPI-Specification GitHub repo, and I've based the way to split this on this blog post: [developerjack - Maintaining large design-first API specs](https://developerjack.com/blog/2018/maintaining-large-design-first-api-specs/).
